# Julia Britland's Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

I completed the Google Data Analytics certificate and this was the final project. For this project, I used RStudio to clean and transform my data. This was an exploratory project and 
I am eager to learn to do more with R; however, this particular case study is limited in scope due to other learning priorities that came up at the end of my course.
For now, this case study includes an HTML report knitted from an R markdown file. I intend to learn more R in the future and do a more comprehensive case study.

You may see the code at this [link](https://posit.cloud/content/6714591). The rmd file and all csv files used are contained in the folder "cloud/project/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16".
